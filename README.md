# Grass Roots Mobile Survey App

The Grass Roots Mobile Survey App is focused on providing affordable field survey capacity to nonprofits worldwide. 

## Brief History

After working with nonprofits in Nepal, India, Cambodia and Ethiopia, founder Trish Perkins recognized a need for mobile field surveys which sync with Salesforce. After perusing the market (TaroWorks, FormAssembly, etc.), she realized that none of these solutions were affordable for her clients. She set out to assemble a team of developers and others interested in making this service available not only to her clients, but to others in the nonprofit community. 

## Project Vision

The Grass Roots Mobile Survey App team believes that mobile technology is critically important for meeting the missions of many nonprofits worldwide. These nonprofits must have agents in the field to bring their services to those in need who are unable to come to a central office. Often, the nonprofit's constituents are better served in their home environments. The urgency created by Covid19 requires readiness to deploy the app as soon as conditions permit return to the field. 

What We've Been Up To (It's been a long long road!)
